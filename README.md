Features:

- Sticky Header.
- Header contains Search Bar, Search Categor.es, Sort Dropdown and Cart with Item Count.
- Product cards contain Product Image, Product Title, Price, MSRP and ATC button.
- Number of Results Displayed along with Search Query.
- Pagination at Bottom with Previous and Next Buttons.
- Mobile Responsive.

This project is built with React and plain ol' CSS.

Things I would have done differently with no time contraints:

- Add Filtering.
- Add Badges.
- Use Scss.
- Add Cypress tests.
