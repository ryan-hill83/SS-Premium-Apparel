Features:

- Sticky Header.
- Header contains 'Search Bar', 'Search Categories', 'Sort Dropdown' and 'Cart with Item Count'.
- Product cards contain 'Product Image', 'Product Title', 'Price', 'MSRP' and 'ATC button'.
- Number of results displayed along with search query.
- Pagination at bottom with previous and next buttons.
- Load default image if no product image loads.
- Mobile responsive.

This project is built with React and plain ol' CSS.

Things I would have done differently with no time contraints:

- Add Filtering.
- Add Badges.
- Use Scss.
- Add Cypress tests.
